Here is the README.md file for your time-series sales prediction project:

# Time Series Sales Prediction

This repository contains a project for predicting sales using time-series data and various LSTM models. The main focus of this project is the development and evaluation of LSTM models to predict future sales based on historical data.

### Capabilities

- Predicts future sales using LSTM models trained on historical sales data.
- Evaluates the performance of different LSTM models to identify the best-performing model.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TIME-SERIES-SALES-PREDICTION.git
   cd TIME-SERIES-SALES-PREDICTION
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```sh
   python -m venv sales_prediction_env
   source sales_prediction_env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `sales_prediction_env\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Running the Notebook

To run the Jupyter notebook locally, use the following command:
```sh
jupyter notebook Notebook.ipynb
```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook in your browser.
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the models, and evaluate their performance.
3. Use the trained models to make sales predictions for future periods.
